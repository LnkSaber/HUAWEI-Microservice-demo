# Transport

## Introduction
this part define the settings related about network communication

## Configurations

**transport.failure.{protocol_name}**
> *(required, string)* the name of the protocol client, now only support rest failure. a string list connect with comma,each string 
starts with http_, combine with http status code.
you can define what can be considered as failure 
and make it count in circuit breaker and fault-tolerance module


**transport.maxIdleCon.{protocol_name}**
> *(required, string)* MaxIdleConns controls the maximum number of idle (keep-alive) connections 
across all hosts. Zero means no limit. it only works for rest protocol

## Example
The cases of http_500,http_502 are considered as unsuccessful attempts
```
cse:
  transport:
    failure:
      rest: http_500,http_502
    maxIdleCon:
      rest: 1024
```

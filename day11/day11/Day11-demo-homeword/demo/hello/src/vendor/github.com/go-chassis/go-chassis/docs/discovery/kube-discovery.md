# Kubernetes

Kubernetes discovery is a service discovery choice, it implements ServiceDiscovery Plugin,
which leads go-chassis to do service discovery in kubernetes cluster according to Services. 

## Import Path

kube discovery is a service discovery plugin that should import in your application code explicitly.

```go
import _ "github.com/go-chassis/go-chassis-plugins/registry/kube"
```

## Configurations

If you set cse.service.Registry.serviceDiscovery.type as "kube", then "configPath" is necessary to comminucate with kubernetes cluster. The go-chassis consumer applications would find Endpoints and Services in cluster that provider applications deployed.

> NOTE:  Provider applications with go-chassis must deploy itself as a Pod asscociate with Services. The Service ports must be named and the port name must be the form **\<protocol>[-\<suffix>]**. protocol can set to be `rest` or `highway` now.

```yaml
cse:
  service:
    Registry:
      serviceDiscovery:
        type: kube
        configPath: /etc/.kube/config
```
